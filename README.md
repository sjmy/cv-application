# cv-application

CV Application project for The Odin Project

Built with React. Enter CV details in the forms on the left and see a formatted CV displayed on the right. Includes a section for education, work experience, and a profile. Additional section can be added to the sidebar as needed. Downloads/prints the display CV.

Future development ideas: formatting options (justification, font size and colour, backgrounds), add sections to main body and rename them, drag to reorder sections/items on the input side. Display scaling needs work. Download/print representation currently does not match perfectly.

Uses [react-to-print](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-to-print) to print/download the display CV container.

Deployed using [Vercel](https://cv-application-swart-psi.vercel.app/)
